Windows Application for managing contacts
This is a simple windows form application in C# to manage user contact list, it is going to save darta in access database file and has got Save, Search, Edit and list functions dor it is going to implement all CRUD operations. I expect to finish this application in less than four hours and as I do not work continuously I think in less than one week this application will be finished and then I am going to add the option to change language and make it bilingual and add Persian language as well.
